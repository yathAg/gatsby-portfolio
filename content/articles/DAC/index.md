## 61st Design Automation Conference

Attending a conference in the United States for the first time was an exciting experience, and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The week leading up to the event was spent preparing a poster to showcase my work as part of the DAC Young Scholars Program. Being selected for this program was my gateway to participating in this global conference that brought together industry and academia. Over the span of five days, I attended numerous talks, which provided a multidimensional insight into the EDA industry. I connected with people from around the world and, to top it off, explored the vibrant city of San Francisco. Although it’s challenging to summarize everything I learned or remember every session I attended, as I constantly hopped between the countless parallel sessions, I’ve done my best to capture my key takeaways and the sessions that gave me much food for thought.

### Key Industry Trends

**Hardware and Software Interaction:** Understanding the interaction between hardware and software is crucial, and it’s important to delve deeply into each layer. When building new hardware architectures, analyzing the different levels of abstraction in software has a profound impact. Similarly, leveraging hardware requires designing software accordingly. Jim Keller emphasized this in his keynote, showcasing how Tensorrent leverages multiple local compute units that excel in long-distance data communication.

**Chiplets:** Almost every major company and talk mentioned chiplets, supported by strong evidence. Unlike AI, which is often used as a buzzword, chiplets are a significant trend due to the challenges of developing technologies beyond the 5nm and 3nm technodes without sacrificing yield and manufacturing costs. As designs evolved to have entire systems on chips, die sizes expanded to their limits. This raises the question: Is Moore's Law dying? The industry has shifted towards using chiplets or multiple dies on the same PCB. This approach uses smaller dies with higher yields, allowing for dies with different technodes in one package. However, it also presents challenges related to mechanical and thermal stresses and the need for appropriate communication protocols between chips to keep Moore's Law alive.

**Digital Twins:** This term is beloved by marketing teams and leadership roles, even though it's essentially a fancy term for simulations—the foundation of silicon EDA since its inception. The cost of failure is increasing, and time to market is becoming more crucial. Creating a digital twin of a system can predict functionality and make the development cycle parallel. While the advantages of digital twins are notable, it doesn’t justify creating a digital twin for everything in existence.

## Technical talks

### How AI Will Drive EDA and IP Growth: Insights from Charles Shi

Charles Shi delivered an outstanding and well-structured talk, providing a comprehensive view of the EDA industry from a Wall Street perspective. It was truly mind-blowing to see how historical facts and trends can be pieced together to predict future developments.

In the era of personal computing, Intel reigned supreme in the semiconductor industry, controlling both the hardware and foundry aspects. The next phase, the mobile computing era, saw a shift to fabless manufacturers, though software and hardware were still produced by different companies. As we transition into the age of AI computing, Nvidia has emerged as the leader, controlling the entire software and hardware stacks while relying solely on TSMC for manufacturing. This trend is being followed by more and more companies, with Apple leading in the personal computing space and Meta, Microsoft, and Google developing their own chips.

Given these observations, the prediction is that Nvidia will continue to dominate the field. As computing demands grow, designs will increasingly rely on chiplets. Therefore, EDA companies must focus on investing in tools for chiplet-based designs to stay ahead in this evolving landscape.
