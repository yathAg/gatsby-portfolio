### A fun weekend getaway

I finally completed my first quarter marathon! It still amazes me how some people run 42 kilometers, but I’m proud of my achievement. This journey started a month ago when Naman practically forced me to register for the run. Without him and Rishab, there's no way I would have participated. Although I practiced a few times on the treadmill, race day was a completely different experience. The past week in Delhi had been drenched with rain, leaving the air humid and the morning heat intense, even at 6 AM. But, after a mix of jogging and walking, I completed the run in 90 minutes and earned my medal and bragging rights.

Of course, I didn’t travel all the way to Delhi just to run a 10K (though I'd like to put it that way). Over the next two days, with every muscle in my body aching in turns, we explored Hauz Khas and Khan Market and indulged in some amazing food at Gulati’s.

Despite warnings of floods and just recovering from the marathon, we hit the road for the final leg of our trip. Our early morning journey took us to Vrindavan, where we encountered monkeys who had mastered the art of trading stolen glasses for mango juice. Yes, you heard that right—they snatch your glasses and won’t return them until you offer them "Frooti Pilado." Due to the overwhelming crowds, we couldn’t make it to the temple, so we set off for our next destination: the Taj Mahal.

I bet you can’t name all seven wonders of the world right now, and honestly, I think the list is a bit odd. But this stunning marvel of a mausoleum, the Taj Mahal, truly takes your breath away at first sight. Its immense size and perfect symmetry are awe-inspiring. After countless photos and marveling at its beauty, we wrapped up our Agra visit with unforgettable Mughlai cuisine.

Our final stop was the Pink City—Jaipur, my hometown. After a few rounds around the city and a visit to Hawa Mahal, which has held a special place in my heart since childhood, we got some well-deserved rest.

The next morning, we headed to Nahargarh Fort, which Raja Sawai Jai Singh II built as a retreat for him and his concubines. The fort offers a breathtaking view of the city, and I ended my road trip with a unique taste of Jaipur’s famous Lal Maas.
With an exhausting but fun adventure behind us, Naman and Rishab headed back to Gurgaon, promising another trip next year. As for me, I went to my beloved Nani’s house, cherishing the memories we made.
