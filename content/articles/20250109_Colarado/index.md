## Exploring the Redlands and Vegas: Nature, Adventure, and Glamour

Most people take year-end vacations, but I kicked off the new year with a wild adventure across the United States—a 2000-kilometer road trip from Boulder to Las Vegas. It’s not something I would have ever attempted on my own, but with Rishab, its always “why not?”.

Our five-day journey began at CU Boulder, weaving through awe-inspiring landscapes with stops at Arches National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park, before culminating in the dazzling lights of Las Vegas. At first, the thought of driving in the U.S. was a bit intimidating—this was my first time behind the wheel here—but the breathtaking mountain views along the way made every moment unforgettable. To my surprise, driving in the States turned out to be a breeze, thanks to well-maintained highways and disciplined drivers who actually follow the rules. The adventure was as exhilarating as the destinations themselves, making it a trip to remember.

### Chasing Sunsets at Arches National Park

The trip began at a sluggish pace, stuck in an hour-long traffic jam on I-70. But once the road cleared, we were finally on our way. While planning our route, inspired by a YouTube video, we decided to take a detour along State Highway 128, even though it added an extra hour to the journey. That decision turned out to be one of the best of the trip. Unlike the fast-paced monotony of the three-lane I-70, Highway 128 meanders through Utah’s stunning landscapes. With empty roads and not another soul in sight for miles, we were treated to breathtaking views, enhanced by scenic turnouts placed at all the perfect spots.

We arrived at Arches National Park just before sunset and set off on a short 3-kilometer hike to witness the iconic Delicate Arch. As the sun dipped below the horizon, it cast its gorgeous vermilion hues across the arch and onto the snow-capped La Sal Mountains in the distance—a sight that felt almost surreal. With hearts full from the day’s adventure, we headed back to our stay in Moab to wrap up an incredible first day.

### From Mesa Arches to Bryce Canyon's Whimsical Hoodoos

Miraculously, we managed to make it out on time for a short hike to the Mesa Arch in Canyonlands National Park. While the arch itself may have felt a bit underwhelming, the stunning cliffside views stretching across the horizon, bathed in the soft hues of dawn, more than made up for it. After taking in the sights, we left Canyonlands and headed to our next destination.

Driving through Capitol Reef National Park, we didn’t get the chance to explore its main viewpoints. To add a touch of suspense, a park ranger warned us about a potential incoming snowstorm. Thankfully, it amounted to nothing more than a gentle dusting of snow as we continued through the enchanting Dixie National Forest. The drive felt like something out of a storybook, with pine trees lining both sides of the road and occasional glimpses of expansive snow-covered mountains. We even spotted tiny stick-like figures riding gondolas up to ski resorts nestled in the peaks—a truly magical sight.

As dusk approached, we arrived at Bryce Canyon National Park and embarked on a trail along the canyon rim. This gave us our first glimpse of the fascinating and whimsical hoodoos, their strange, sculpted forms illuminated in the fading light.

### Into the Heart of Bryce Canyon and the Journey to Las Vegas

After a restful night in Panguitch, we set out for our final day in the red rock wonderland—a hike into the heart of Bryce Canyon, home to its peculiar, towering hoodoos, seemingly sculpted over millennia by mythical giants. Here’s an intriguing fun fact: according to Native American lore, these hoodoos represent human souls punished by the trickster Coyote for their sins. This eerie myth added a fascinating layer to our journey.

We embarked on the Navajo and Peekaboo Loop trail combination—a 7.5-kilometer trek with 500 meters of elevation change that took about three hours to complete. Unlike the Grand Canyon’s steep, relentless descent, this hike was much more dynamic, with gentle ups and downs that let us fully immerse ourselves in the beauty around us. Walking among the massive hoodoos, passing under stunning natural arches carved into the rock, and taking in the breathtaking views at every turn made it the highlight of the trip.

While the trek was undoubtedly physically demanding, it offered an unmatched sense of satisfaction. For those three hours, every sense was alive—the chirping of birds, the crisp canyon air, the earthy scent of dry mud and pinecones, and the sight of the winding trail cutting through a picturesque, otherworldly landscape.

After the hike, we drove through the rest of Bryce Canyon to soak in its remaining splendor before heading off on our final leg to Las Vegas. The journey took us back through the scenic State Highway 128 and Interstate 15, where we traded the tranquility of the wilderness for the glittering glamor and glitz of the Las Vegas Strip.

### Vegas: Glitz, Gambling, and Gourmet Disappointments

Hyped across cultures and immortalized by movies like The Hangover and Now You See Me, Las Vegas has always held a certain allure. Add to that the excitement of F1 hosting a race in the city, and we were buzzing with anticipation. However, we arrived with absolutely no plans for how to spend our two days there. Friends had mentioned that Vegas could be surprisingly affordable, but somehow, we seemed to miss that memo. Most of the shows and activities we came across were either well beyond our modest budget or completely sold out.

For the most part, I’ll stick to the old adage: “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.” That said, it was fascinating to wander through the opulent halls of the Bellagio and Caesars Palace, soaking in their grandeur. We also experienced the vibrant and quirky atmosphere of Fremont Street, a place brimming with life and entertainment. Of course, no trip to Vegas would be complete without trying our luck at the slot machines. We spent $20 on some quirky ones—not with any expectation of winning but to get a sense of what draws people to mindlessly tap away at them.

We also couldn’t miss the famed Las Vegas buffets and decided to try the Wicked Spoon. The spread was undeniably vast, offering an array of impressive dishes. However, in my opinion, it didn’t quite live up to the hype—I’ve had better meals at restaurants specializing in a single cuisine.

Even though our Vegas experience didn’t match the cinematic fantasies, it was a whirlwind of vibrant energy, indulgence, and quirky charm. 

### End of the Road: Farewell to an Unforgettable Journey

With a relaxing end to our adventure, we bid farewell to our trusty companion, the Chevrolet Malibu, and headed back to Purdue, ready to embrace 2025. This nature-filled and glam-soaked road trip is one I’ll cherish for years to come—and, of course, one I won’t stop talking about in the days ahead!
