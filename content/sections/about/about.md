Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Yatharth Agarwal, a graduate student at Purdue University, where I'm delving into the exciting worlds of VLSI, PCB Design, and Robotics.

When I'm not buried in coursework or tinkering with circuits, you can catch me cheering on my favorite F1 drivers, immersing myself in the latest blockbuster movies, or getting lost in the pages of a good book. 

Join me as I navigate the twists and turns of the tech industry and strive to make a meaningful impact through my work. Let's embark on this journey together!
